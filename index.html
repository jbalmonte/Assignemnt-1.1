                The classical approach in management has conventionally implied traditionally accepted views. This
                approach
                believes in functional interrelationships, following of certain principles based on experience, a
                bureaucratic structure, and a reward–punishment nexus. It is composed of three directions: the
                scientific
                management approach, the administrative approach, and the bureaucratic approach that are
                working side by side. The scientific approach focuses on a micro-segment in the organization,
                such as its workers, based on how they should do things inclined with science and evidence.
                Moreover, the administrative approach was designed for managers to plan, organize, command,
                coordinate, and control things inside the business. The bureaucratic approach, on the other
                hand, targeted the bigger picture and against favoritism and put the right person in a specific
                work. As mentioned, these are still present in today’s practices. </p>

            <h1>Neo-Classical Management</h1>

        The neoclassical theory was an attempt at incorporating the behavioral sciences into management thought
        in order to solve the problems caused by classical theory practices. The premise of this inclusion was
        based on the idea that the role of management is to use employees to get things done in organizations.
        Rather than focus on production, structures, or technology, the neoclassical theory was concerned with
        the employee. Neoclassical theorists concentrated on answering questions related to the best way to
        motivate, structure, and support employees within the organization.

        Studies during this time, including the popular Hawthorne studies, revealed that social factors, such as
        employee relationships, were an important factor for managers to consider. It was believed that any
        manager who failed to account for the social needs of his or her employees could expect to deal with
        resistance and lower performance. Employees needed to find some intrinsic value in their jobs, which
        they certainly were not getting from the job that was highly standardized. Rather than placing employees
        into job roles, where they completed one specific task all day with little to no interaction with
        coworkers, employees could be structured in such a way that they would frequently share tasks,
        information, and knowledge with one another. The belief was that once employees were placed into this
        alternate structure, their needs for socialization would be fulfilled, and thus they would be more
        productive.
